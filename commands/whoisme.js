Hey, I'm Yosef!ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a software engineer dedicated to building engaging, high-quality websites like this one.
My journey in tech began in 2023 when I started studying Computer Science.
While diving into my college studies, I found myself learning even more outside the classroom,
driven by the goal of landing a rewarding role in this field.

-

Learning has become more than a habit; itâ€™s a passion. Iâ€™m hungry for information and constantly pushing myself to improve.
I wanted to learn *everything*â€”Machine Learning, DevOps, and not just the tech world.
I wanted to explore roles like HR and Product Management to truly understand all sides of building impactful projects.Over time, 
Iâ€™ve worked on a wide range of projects, both for fun and for practice,
and I've enjoyed helping my peers navigate the vast world of software engineering and computer science. 

-

What started as a personal journey became an online presence thatâ€™s connected me with a world of knowledge and innovation.
My goal? To keep learning, keep growing, and maybe even make a significant impact on humanity along the way.
Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey takes me nextâ€”and what I can create as I strive to become the best version of myself.
